               Here at Healing Hearts, we aim to raise awareness on mental illness, specifically
               depression. According to the World Health Organization, it is defined as a common
               mental disorder that involves a depressed mood or loss of pleasure or interest in
               activities for long periods of time. Studies have shown less than 10% of adults
               in the US suffer from depression in some form. One major form being suicide.
               Society has looked down upon mental health such as depression which makes it hard
               for people to disclose their feelings due to ridicule and embarrassment. We want
               to shine light on the natural ways one can go about treating depression naturally
               and help solve or reduce the amount of suffering with this mental illness in all
               its degrees.

               Families play an important role in understanding there responsbilities
               towards the people suffering from depression in their lives. Serving
               as an outlet of support and comfort, friends and family need to educate
               themselves on the different methods that can be used to assist in the
               recovery process on the depressed. Ignoring someone is just as bad as
               teasing and ridiculing them. We need not be embarresed or ashamed by
               them and uplift. Undrestanding that we could potentially be a contributor
               to this depression unkowingly, causing more harm than good.

                     <ul>
                        <li>When you preform yoga you can increase the levels of gamma-
                           aminobutyric acid (GABA). This is a neurotransmitter in the brain

                           can ease the pain of depression. Being apart of groups or clubs
